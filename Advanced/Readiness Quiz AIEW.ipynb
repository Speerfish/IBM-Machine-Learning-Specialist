You may use external resources such as the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) or answers on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), but you may not copy others' code. After you have updated the code blocks, you call the relevant functions and compare the outputs with the solutions notebook which we have provided separately.
